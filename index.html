        <p> Bhutan is a small Himalayan country of 750,000 people.In Bhutan over one-third of the population lives below the poverty line. </p>
        <p>The poverty rate of the Bhutan in 2022 was 12.4% because of the poverty rate it leads to other issue like child labours. Ninety-six percent affected by the causes of poverty in Bhutan live in rural areas.  </p>
        <p> What causes poverty?</p>
        <p> There are many factors causing poverty in Bhutan and are the struggle of large families, students and laborers and the force nature. </p>
        <h4>Struggle of Large Families, Students and Laborers.</h4>
        <p>Large families with a high dependency ratio (children and adults who cannot work) experience more poverty in both urban and rural areas. As of 2004, 49 percent of families in the rural areas of Bhutan had six or more members. These families experience labor shortages forcing them to migrate in search for better opportunities. </p>
        <p> A student in Bhutan’s rural regions may have to walk two to three hours each way to access the nearest primary school. Because access to education is difficult and limited, the adult literacy rate and opportunities to gain productive skills in the rural areas remain low. </p>
        <p>For small traders outside of Bhutan’s agriculture-based economy, low earnings are often not enough to overcome poverty. Even when laborers and traders work more than one job, they are often unable to earn enough to live consistently above the poverty line.</p>
        <h4> Force of the Nature.</h4>
        <p>One cause of poverty in Bhutan cannot be controlled like natural disasters like floods and landslides, can wreak havoc on communities and ruin crops and forcing those already living in proverty to rebuild their lives. </p>

        <p>The poverty line at Nu 6,204 per person per month represents the level of consumption needed to secure the necessities of life. It is obtained by adding estimated food and non-food requirements of Nu 2,852 and Nu 3,352 respectively.</p>
